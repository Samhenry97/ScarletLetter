						<h2>What is it about?</h2>
						<p><i>The Scarlet Letter</i> is about a woman named Hester Prynne. She lives in the Puritan town of Boston. Hester has committed adultery when her husband was presumed lost at sea, and is forced to wear the scarlet letter "A" woven into her clothing for the rest of her life as punishment. During her trial, her supposed long-lost husband shows up. The story is about how she has to live with the scarlet letter, and how she has to live in shame because of her sin. Her daughter Pearl even suffers consequences, as she is shunned by other children. Through all this shame, her husband tries to get revenge on the man who sinned with her.</p>
