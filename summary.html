					<p>The book <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne, is a book about adultery and the punishment of sin. Each character contributes in his own way to the full story. Hester Prynne, the main character, is the one who has to wear the scarlet letter as a sign of her sin. Arthur Dimmesdale is the minister of the town, and the one who sinned with Hester. Roger Chillingworth is Hester's true husband, and he also serves as the town physician throughout the book. The last main character is Pearl, Hester's only daughter. This story takes place in Boston, Massachusetts in the mid 1600s.</p>

					<p>A crowd is gathered around the pedestal where Hester Prynne stands on trial. The town ministers question her and try to find out who sinned with her. As Hester refuses to answer, she spots a man in the crowd, whom she recognizes immediately. This man is her true husband, who has been lost at sea for years, presumed dead. The man, with the alias "Roger Chillingworth", asks a person in the crowd what Hester has done. The person tells him that she has committed adultery. Her sentence is to wear a scarlet letter, "A", knit into her clothing for the remainder of her life.</p>

					<p>While Hester is in the prison cell, Roger comes in as a physician to look after her. He asks who her lover was, and she won't tell him. Chillingworth forces her to agree to never reveal him as her husband, which she reluctantly agrees to. After she is released from prison, Hester goes to a cottage on the edge of town, where she raises her child, Pearl, and lives on needlework. Throughout these years, Pearl becomes an outcast among the other children. In a visit to some of the town officials, some of the authorities even talk about taking away Hester's custody of Pearl.</p>

					<p>A few years later, the town minister, Arthur Dimmesdale, begins to fail in health. Because of this, Chillingworth moves in with him so Dimmesdale can be looked after. Chillingworth begins to suspect that this illness is not just from some bodily infection, but from hiding some unconfessed sin. One night, while Dimmesdale is sleeping, Chillingworth sees the scarlet letter A on Arthur, revealing his sin to Chillingworth.</p>

					<p>After several days, Hester and Dimmesdale meet in the woods, where she rips off her letter, and they plan to sail to Europe, where they can start their life over. Dimmesdale is happy and filled with energy after this, until the Election Day. On Election Day, Hester discovers that Chillingworth is also traveling on the boat that she and Dimmesdale will be going on to Europe. After Dimmesdale preaches his "best" sermon, Dimmesdale stumbles and falls, then confesses his sin with Hester in his arms. He dies within moments after his confession, which he has been hiding for 7 years. Soon after, Chillingworth dies because his desire for revenge is gone, and leaves a fortune for Pearl. Hester lives the rest of her life helping women in similar positions to her, while the book hints that Pearl moves on to Europe.</p>
